  "body": "# Disclaimer\r\nFirst of all, I did not create this modloader!\r\nA friend of mine helped me build the base for this modloader, so some of the credit goes to him.\r\nFor anyone interested, my friend's online name is TesseractCat.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis modloader allows users to program mods for Ori and The Blind Forest and load them into the game, hence the name.\r\nIt includes a handful of in-game functions to help you with the development of your mods, such as:\r\n\r\n### The Console\r\nThe console allows you to see the keybindings to toggle the other windows that are included in the modloader, and it also displays all the mods that have been loaded into your game.\r\n\r\n### The Debug Window\r\nThe Debug Window displays all errors that the game logs, so it's most useful for mod developers, but who knows, you might manage to screw something up even without mods! ;)\r\n\r\n### The Object Browser\r\nThe Object Browser allows you to see a very, very big list of every object currently in the game. All the object's names come up as buttons that delete the object when clicked on.\r\n\r\n### The Object Editor\r\nThe Object Editor allows you to select an object by hovering the cursor over it and pressing LeftShift+MouseLeftClick. You can then, using the window, edit the selected object's position, scale, see it's name, delete it and see a list of every component that is attached to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n### Original Edition\r\nBe sure to backup your files first!!!\r\nDownload the contents of the modloader.\r\nGo to your Steam installation folder, then steamapps\\common\\Ori\\ori_data\\Managed.\r\nPaste the contents from the respective folder into the 'Managed' folder.\r\nAccept if prompted to replace files.\r\n\r\n### Definitive Edition\r\nBe sure to backup your files first!!!\r\nDownload the contents of the modloader.\r\nGo to your Steam installation folder, then steamapps\\common\\Ori DE\\oriDE_data\\Managed.\r\nPaste the contents from the respective folder into the 'Managed' folder.\r\nAccept if prompted to replace files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Creating Mods\r\nFirst of all, you need an IDE. [Download Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).\r\n\r\nThen, open it, and in the left, click New Project. Get your bearings and find C#. From there, create a new Class Library. (Not the one that has Package!)\r\nOn the bottom of that window, take note of the Location.\r\n\r\nThen, on the right, in the Solution Explorer, rightclick References->Add Reference, and click Browse. Go to the game's Managed folder again, and choose SeinModLoader.dll, Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll\r\n\r\nThen add [this code](http://pastie.org/10721786). (It's the same contained in the .cs file from the sample code folder).\r\nDon't know where to add the code? On the right, click Class1.cs or whatever it is named.\r\n\r\nI could explain the basics of C# programming, but you should have at least some knowledge on it before you start modding, so go ahead and learn, then come back. ;)\r\n\r\nAfter you're done coding, press LeftControl+LeftShit+B. Give it a little bit, usually around a few seconds.\r\nThen navigate to the Location we covered above, and find a folder called \"bin\".\r\nThen open it -> \"Debug\" and grab \"YourModName.dll\" and place that file in the Mods folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits and Copyright\r\nCredits go to my friend Ivan 'TesseractCat' for creating the base of the modloader for another game, me for porting it to 'Ori and The Blind Forest', and Moon Studios for 'Assembly-CSharp.dll', that's entirely their work except for my 3 lines required to port, but without them, this wouldn't be possible because... well, there would be no game to mod. \r\n\r\nMoon Studios does have copyright on 'Assembly-CSharp.dll', as well as every other assembly of the game, but one of the devs said I could probably keep the modloader up if I wanted, and I probably wouldn't have any problems. She also talked to a couple other members of the development team and they didn't seem to oppose, so I'll just assume I have permission. :3\r\n\r\n",
